## Bookstore script with Rails & MySQL

Basic app that implements a CRUD system for books. It uses Ruby on Rails, MySQL and Twitter Bootstrap.

## Motivation

This script is part of my journey into learning Ruby on Rails and taking my development skills to the next level by developing real applications. I intend to update this and other projects while I improbe my skills.

## Using it

There are several examples of implementations at the end of the JS files. To test them, you'll need to uncomment the desired implementation.

## Contributors

The script is by no means a production ready script. You can do with it what you want and of course suggest any improvements.
